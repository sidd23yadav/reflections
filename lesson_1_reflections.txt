What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It is just usefull since i wouldn't want to make a lot of commits and sometimes not usefull since i would like to make them frequently.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Maybe that depends on their user base and marketability. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

     enter git log and then browse through the commits. Select the relevant commits and see the differences btwn them using git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
